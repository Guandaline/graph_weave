# 📝 Commit Message Guide – graph_weave

This guide defines the commit message standard used in the `graph_weave` project. A good commit history makes collaboration, review, and change tracking easier.

---

## ✅ Recommended Structure

```
<type>(optional scope): brief, imperative description

[optional body explaining the reason and context for the change]

[optional refs: issues, tasks, PRs]
```

---

## 🎯 Commit Types

| Type        | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `feat`      | New feature |
| `fix`       | Bug fix |
| `docs`      | Documentation change |
| `style`     | Formatting (no logic change) |
| `refactor`  | Refactoring without changing functionality |
| `test`      | Adding or improving tests |
| `chore`     | Project maintenance (CI, dependencies, etc) |
| `perf`      | Performance improvements |
| `security`  | Security fixes or adjustments |
| `bot`       | Commits generated by automated agents |

## 🧠 Examples

```
feat(cache): add support for TTL and fallback

fix(secrets): prevent failure when fetching expired secret

refactor(logging): separate formatting responsibility

bot(agent-dev): generate retry module with tests and documentation

```

## 🛑 Best Practices

- Use **imperative mood**: “add”, not “added”
- Be **clear and specific**
- Prefer **frequent and atomic** commits
- Avoid generic messages like “update” or “fixes”

Keeping a clean and descriptive history is key to a sustainable project.
