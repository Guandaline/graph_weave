# 📜 Code of Conduct — graph_weave

This Code of Conduct (“CoC”) applies to **all individuals** and **automated agents** interacting with the `graph_weave` project — including code, documentation, issues, PRs, discussions, chats, events, and automations. Our goal is to maintain a **safe, inclusive, respectful**, and **high technical quality** environment.

> **Reporting contact:** `security@example.com` (update to official contact)

## 1) Purpose
Promote responsible, transparent, and sustainable collaboration, guided by the principles of Software Engineering and best practices in security, privacy, and engineering.

## 2) Scope
This CoC applies to all spaces associated with the project:
- Repositories, issues, PRs, discussions, wikis, and documentation;
- Communication channels (email, chats, calls, events);
- Human interactions and **execution of agents** configured to operate in the project ecosystem.

## 3) Principles
- **Respect and inclusion:** we value diverse perspectives and constructive feedback.  
- **Transparency and integrity:** technical decisions and automations must be explainable and auditable.  
- **Quality and security:** we follow standards for code, testing, observability, and data protection.

## 4) Behavior Standards (Humans)
**Expected**
- Professional, clear, and welcoming communication;
- Clean, testable, and documented code;
- Use of inclusive and accessible language (avoid unnecessary jargon);
- Respect for `CONTRIBUTING.md` guidelines.

**Unacceptable (examples)**
- Harassment, insults, personal attacks, offensive jokes;
- Disclosure of confidential information or secrets;
- Sabotage of technical discussions or manipulation of review processes;
- Discrimination based on any personal attribute.

## 5) Behavior Standards (Automated Agents)
- Operate **exclusively** within authorized scope;
- **Identify commits** and actions (prefix `bot:`) and maintain **auditable logs**;
- Respect **security policies** (secrets, tokens, PII);
- Do not rewrite code outside the assigned task;
- **Minimum explainability:** record objective, input, output, and limitations;
- **Reliability:** prioritize stability, idempotence, and predictability.

## 6) Security, Privacy, and Ethics
- Never expose credentials, PII, or sensitive data in code, logs, commits, or issues;
- Use trusted and actively maintained dependencies;
- Handle incidents with priority, following best practices for response and communication.

## 7) Accessibility and Inclusion
- Prefer simple language; provide context and references;
- Consider time zones and provide asynchronous materials when possible;
- Offer alternative formats upon request (e.g., text, slides, recordings).

## 8) How to Report Violations
Send an email to `security@example.com` with:
- **Description** of the incident/conduct;
- **Location** (link to issue/PR/commit/chat);
- **Date and time** (if possible);
- **Evidence** (screenshots, logs, links).

**Commitments upon receiving a report**
- Acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**;
- Initial analysis and containment measures, when applicable;
- Communicate the outcome, preserving confidentiality and non-retaliation.

## 9) Enforcement Guidelines (Escalation)
Measures may vary according to severity, recurrence, and context:

1. **Private guidance** (educational, internal record);
2. **Formal warning** (documented);
3. **Temporary restrictions** (participation, permissions, agent execution);
4. **Suspension** for a determined period;
5. **Ban** (removal of access/participation);
6. **Reversion of commits / closing PRs** associated with the violation.

> Severe cases (e.g., harassment, doxxing, intentional secret leaks) may skip steps.

## 10) Conflicts of Interest
- Declare potential conflicts when reviewing/approving changes that may directly benefit you;
- Agents must record **source/limits** of decisions (data, prompts, rules).

## 11) Governance and Updates
- **Maintainers** are responsible for interpreting and enforcing this CoC;
- This document is **versioned** in the repository;
- Suggestions for improvement are welcome via PR.
